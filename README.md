# Regression-Analysis-of-steel-Items
The attached dataset “daily_offers.xlsx” is a representation of steel items offered to customers. Each row represents an item, and has an offered/selling price of that item. Finally, we are required to create a detailed report to document our work where you may showcase your analysis, visualizations, results, findings, etc.
